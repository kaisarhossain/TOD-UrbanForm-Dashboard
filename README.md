# TOD-UrbanForm-Dashboard

**ðŸ“Œ Project Summary**

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis and interactive visualization of urban form typologies surrounding public transit stations in the United States. The primary aim is to provide urban planners, transit agencies, and researchers with intuitive insights into the built environment characteristics near transit stops, supporting more informed decisions around land use, density, and accessibility planning.

The dashboard is built using Streamlit and visualizes various spatial and structural attributes within buffer zones (200m, 400m, and 800m) around transit stations. It provides typology-based comparisons, visual analytics, and interactive maps for urban form interpretation.
